This repository houses a collection of my assignments and projects from an intensive graduate-level course on 'Automated Reasoning.' Throughout this course,
I delved into the theory and practice of automated reasoning, focusing on propositional and first-order logic. I acquired a deep understanding of the syntax 
and semantics of formal logic, and gained proficiency in employing logical reasoning algorithms such as satisfiability and entailment. Exploring the impact 
of syntactic and semantic restrictions on knowledge bases, I discovered their implications for expressiveness, compactness, and computational tractability. 
Moreover, I explored the diverse applications of automated reasoning in areas such as diagnosis, planning, design, formal verification, and reliability 
analysis. Within this folder, you'll find my projects showcasing my adeptness in automated reasoning, logical inference, and their practical applications.
