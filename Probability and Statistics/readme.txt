This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my assignments and projects from a rigorous graduate-level course on 'Probability and Statistics.' 
Throughout this class, I developed a deep understanding of statistical concepts and their practical applications. Leveraging my skills in R programming 
and Matlab, I tackled complex data analysis tasks and implemented sophisticated statistical models. Feel free to explore this folder to witness my 
proficiency in statistical programming and my ability to extract valuable insights from data.
