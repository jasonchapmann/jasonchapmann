This repository houses an array of projects from my enriching graduate-level course on 'Database Management Systems.' Throughout this course, I honed 
my skills in utilizing SQL, NoSQL, PostgreSQL, and other database languages to design, manage, and query databases effectively. By delving into various 
database management best practices, I gained a deep understanding of how to optimize database performance,ensure data integrity, and implement robust 
security measures. Within this folder, you'll find projects that reflect my expertise in designing efficient database schemas, crafting complex queries, 
and leveraging advanced database features. These projects not only showcase my proficiency in handling diverse data models and query languages but also 
highlight my ability to apply database management best practices to ensure scalability, reliability, and data consistency.
