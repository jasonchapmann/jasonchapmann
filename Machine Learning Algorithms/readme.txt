This repository contains my assignments and projects from a graduate-level course on 'Machine Learning Algorithms.' I explored a wide range of topics, 
including optimization techniques, online learning, PCA, graphical models, and privacy considerations. Through hands-on assignments, I gained practical 
experience with gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, boosting algorithms, PCA, and differential privacy. This collection showcases my proficiency 
in applying these machine learning algorithms to solve complex problems. Explore this folder to see my expertise in optimization, online learning, PCA, 
graphical models, and privacy-aware machine learning
